SumDurations({durations})                             *SumDurations()*
		Return a |String| containing the sum of a |List| of
		{durations}.

		A duration is a |String| which follows this pattern: >
			[HH:]MM:SS
<		in which:
		HH represents a number of hours;
		MM represents a number of minutes (which must be less than 60
		   and written with two digits if a number of hours is given);
		SS represents a number of seconds (which must be less than 60
		   and written with two digits).

		You can also write a negative duration by prefixing it with a
		minus ('-') character, in which case the duration is
		subtracted from the total.

		Any argument which is not a valid duration is converted into a
		|Number| of seconds.

		Example: >
			SumDurations([97, "1:00:21", "27:18", "-17:14"])
<		returns "1:12:01".

SumDurationRange([{start} [, {end}]])                    *SumDurationRange()*
		Return a |String| containing the sum of the durations within a
		range of lines.

		If no arguments are given, the range of lines over which the
		durations are taken is either the range given when calling the
		function through |:call|, or the current line.  Otherwise, the
		range of lines spans from the {start} to the {end} (the
		default value of {end} is {start} when not given).

		If the range only spans one line, all durations within the
		line is added up.  Otherwise, only the first duration in each
		line is added up.
